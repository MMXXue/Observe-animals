			<p class="content">Steve Winter is known for his photographs of big cats in their natural habitat, such as snow leopards and tigers. His "ghost cat" story in the December 2013 issue of National Geographic opens with a startling image of the big cat, not in the wilds of India, but in an arguably Shooting his subject in a challenging location - downtown Los Angeles.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Winter was tasked with portraying mountain lions (also known as cougars) in urban settings. His research led him to biologist Jeff Sikich, whose research on mountain lion populations in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area outside Los Angeles seemed promising. "In terms of science, this guy really knew what he was doing," Winter said.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Winter knew that if Los Angeles was his city, he'd want movie stars. Having worked with big cats for many years, he understands the importance of associating them with something instantly recognizable. He heard from the gossip that a cougar was found in Xueer's backyard, and he asked Sikic about the specific situation of the population of cougars.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Winter recalls saying to Sikich, "Wouldn't it be nice to have a picture of a cougar with the Hollywood sign on it..."</p><br>
			<p class="content">But that seems unlikely. So elusive that few people ever see them, many of the animals Sikich tracks leave the Santa Monica play area only to turn back. Even if they do make the trek, they run the risk of being hit by cars crossing the 405 and 101, two busy highways.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Eight months later, Winter got an email from Sikich saying, "You won't believe it because I thought you were crazy when you said that to me." As Griffey Tracking cameras installed to monitor passing wildlife as part of the Griffith Park Connectivity Study captured a mountain lion crossing Highway 101 from the Hollywood Bowl into Griffith Park, where the Hollywood sign is located. The game begins.</p><br>
			<p class="content">"I immediately called my editor, Kathy Moran, and told her I was going out and trying to get a picture of this cougar ... with the Hollywood sign," Winter said.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Winter was then faced with the challenge of setting and securing the camera traps he would use in this attempt. Despite being heavily chained, three of the four cameras he set up were stolen. The camera used to take this photo is the only one that has survived. "That was on animal tracks, not human tracks," Winter said. "Most of what I saw [on that track] were other animal tracks. I saw prints of food for mountain lions."</p><br>
			<p class="content">After 14 months, a photo with a cougar and logo was complete. You might think this would be the end of it.</p><br>
			<p class="content">"Everyone's happy, but I'm not. We're all our own worst critics or our best critics. I went back to L.A. and changed the lighting so there's a shadow around the cat's neck so you don't Seeing the collar [so much]. People were happy I got it, but then it was like, we can do better. So I want to do better, and I know I can."</p><br>
			<p class="content">So Winter tried again, and this time the lighting was just right. When asked how he felt about being successful, he had this to say:</p><br>
			<p class="content">"The story was very difficult. The cougar is a very mysterious animal. It had to be in order to be in downtown Los Angeles and no one but scientists had seen it, so when you have a photo like this that can be iconic , which is a great relief. You talk about urban wildlife and, boom, here’s the picture.”</p>
			<div class="news">
				<p>Latest news: P-22 has been living in Griffith Park for at least six years. He continues to spend most of his time in the most natural areas of Griffith Park. Park, occasionally exploring the edge of the park boundary. He preys primarily on mule deer, the natural prey of mountain lions in the area.</p>
