			<p class="author">This rare, striking photograph of a mating grouper by Laurent Ballesta has won the underwater category and the competition's most prestigious award: Wildlife Photographer of the Year. Ballesta, from France, peers into the ocean depths of Fakarava atoll in French Polynesia as camouflaged groupers emerge from milky clouds of their eggs and sperm. For five years, Ballesta and his team have returned to the lagoon, diving around the clock to watch the creatures spawn each year.</p><br>

			<p class="content">In the depths of the ocean, a camera's flash illuminates a burst of new life. A pair of groupers, fresh from their mating ritual, emerge from a cloud of eggs and sperm in the Fakarava Atoll of French Polynesia. This event is so rare and fleeting that it occurs only once a year, for a mere 30 minutes, during the full moon in July. Photographer Laurent Ballesta spent an astonishing 3,000 hours attempting to capture this moment.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Ballesta's photograph of this extraordinary occurrence, titled "Creation," has earned him the highly coveted Wildlife Photographer of the Year award from London's Natural History Museum, which organizes the annual competition and displays an exhibit of the winning entries.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Described as a "magical moment" by Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the judging panel, in a press release, the photograph captures an "unexpected, energetic, and intriguing" scene of "otherworldly beauty."</p><br>
			<p class="content">Museum director Doug Gurr sees the photograph as "a compelling reminder of what we stand to lose if we do not address humanity's impact on our planet."</p><br>
			<p class="content">The Fakarava Atoll, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve that is shielded from commercial activities, is a sanctuary for numerous threatened and endangered species. One such species is the marbled grouper, which faces the risk of extinction due to large-scale fishing. However, during the mating season of these nearly two-foot-long fish, which is believed to occur around the full moon in June or July, they are safe from human interference. This is because hundreds of gray reef sharks emerge at night to feast on the grouper, whose conservation status remains unknown, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organization responsible for evaluating the global conservation status of species.</p><br>
			<p class="content">To capture this remarkable phenomenon, photographer Laurent Ballesta had to maximize his time underwater, as he had no way to predict the exact timing of the mating ritual. In 2014, he devised a dive protocol that enabled him to spend a full 24 hours at a depth of 65 feet, while limiting the time required for decompression. This extraordinary feat necessitated the calibration of the precise mix of gases in his oxygen tank, a dedicated dive team, and an unwavering determination, according to Ballesta.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Despite swimming among thousands of marbled groupers and hundreds of gray reef sharks without the protection of a shark cage or a metal suit, Ballesta and his team were able to develop the intuition to avoid being bitten. "It took time to develop the intuition that we would not get bitten," Ballesta recounted to National Geographic in 2018. "We had to feel confident enough that when they bump up against us, so hard that sometimes we have bruises, we have to keep calm. They are considering us as obstacles, not prey."</p><br>
